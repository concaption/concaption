 🚀 TL;DR: I am a mechanical engineering undergrad and I do data science and deep learning.
 <br /><br />
👏 During my freshman year, I realized that in whatever the condition one is in, by challenging and focusing on the goal one can improve and improvise oneself. In the first semester, I got a below-average grade point average of 3.09. For me instead of GPA, not having good learning and proper planning were the things worth worrying about. So, I took progress, punctuality, and better planning as a challenge, and by the grace of Allah Almighty, I was able to get into Dean's List by replacing 9 in my GPA from 3.09 to 3.90 at the end of my freshman year.

✨ Hi, I am a zealous mechanical engineering student who loves to challenge mechanical industries to progress towards Industry 4.0.
 <br /><br />
💖 I love MOOCs, OCWs, and all the platforms that are playing their role in free learning.
