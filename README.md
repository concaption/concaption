I am a passionate learner who refuses to settle for mediocrity. My dedication to improvement was demonstrated during my freshman year when I took a below-average GPA of 3.09 and transformed it into a Dean's List worthy 3.90. I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn, whether through MOOCs, OCWs, or other platforms for free education.

I am well-versed in a variety of domains, including NLP, CV, Deep Learning, Data Science, and Machine Learning, as well as Mechanical Engineering Design and Supply Chain Management. My tech stack includes expertise in Pytorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Sci-kit Learn, and Matlab, among others. I am currently learning MLOps and Data Engineering, and am always open to discussing emerging technologies and innovative engineering solutions.

In addition to my technical skills, I speak the languages of design, product, tech, and the art of learning. I am a problem solver at heart, and take ownership of my work, ensuring that the buck stops with me. I am always eager to connect with others and hear their perspectives, so don't hesitate to reach out if you want to discuss anything from emerging tech to case studies.
