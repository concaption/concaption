During my freshman year, I realized that in whatever the condition one is in, by challenging and focusing on the goal one can improve and improvise oneself. In the first semester, I got a below-average grade point average of 3.09. For me instead of GPA, not having good learning and proper planning were the things worth worrying about. So, I took progress, punctuality, and better planning as a challenge, and by the grace of Allah Almighty, I was able to get into Dean's List by replacing 9 in my GPA from 3.09 to 3.90 at the end of my freshman year.

Hi, I am a zealous mechanical engineering student who loves to challenge mechanical industries to progress towards Industry 4.0.

I love MOOCs, OCWs, and all the platforms that are playing their role in free learning.

I can refine, educate and drive myself to be better me.

- I am constantly learning and never settle.
- I speak design, product, tech, and the art of learning.
- The buck stops with me.

I love to meet people and hear their perspectives. Reach out to me if you want to discuss emerging tech, innovative engineering solutions and case studies.
